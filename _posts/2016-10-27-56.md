Parker Phinney, founder of [InterviewCake](http://interviewcake.com), stops by to tell us about coding tests, what to look out for, what to prepare, and how to deal with tough questions.

The bottom line is: you can LEARN how to ace coding tests - it's not really testing how well you can program.

So, anxiety begone - because we've got your back!
